What are ligature fonts?

We often use symbols in our programming code that take multiple characters, but have a single meaning. Ligature fonts take sequences of these characters and make a pleasant single 'token' that is easy to read and make code more readable.

What common symbols would a ligature font make more readable?

Consider common sequences like `->>`, `==`, or `%>%`.
