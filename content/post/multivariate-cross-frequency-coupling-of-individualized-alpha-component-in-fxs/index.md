## Introduction to gedCFC

The multivariate approach to cross frequency coupling offers several advantages to univariate (channel by channel) phase amplitude coupling especially on empirical data. See the method in the original publication developed by Michael X Cohen [here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/21792).

## Scientific Rationale

We decided to implement this method to answer several scientific questions to complete a manuscript. Cohen's other multivariate EEG technique, gedBounds, allowed us to identify coherent spatiotemporal components in a dataset of Fragile X patients (with matched controls). 

FXS is a single gene disorder and the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. FXS has a well-recognized EEG phenotype including decreased alpha power and increased gamma activity. We were interested in understanding how alpha activity varies in FXS from controls. Alpha is a key oscillatory rhythm and as it widely propagates through the brain it is thought to play a role in many physiological processes including attention, sensory gating, and cognition. 

### Altered spatiotemporal properties of alpha activity in FXS

We were able to identify an individualized alpha component (clustered around 10 Hz) for each subject. The mean extent of this component was similar to the canonical alpha band between groups, however, the distribution of these boundaries was altered in FXS. In males with FXS, who have minimal to no protein production, the alpha band lacked a distinctive "start" and "stop" rather than was inconsistent between individuals. Control males, on the other hand, had a distinctly marked alpha band with many individuals having "start" and "stop" points around 7 Hz and 12 hz respectively. In a separate finding, the average topography of this component, especially in males with FXS who have minimal protein production, has a significantly more anterior distribution than in controls. The power of the alpha component was shown to be significantly correlated with auditory attention, which is a neurosensory task studied in FXS.

### Incorporating gedCFC to examine functional connectivity of individualized alpha component in FXS

To complete this story, we were interested in examining cross frequency coupling (CFC) between the individualized alpha component and gamma activity. We hypothesized that anterior alpha activity would demonstrate altered CFC compared to controls. Given that multivariate analysis can incorporate spatial and temporal information, we wondered if an anterior focus of alpha activity would also change the focus of PAC. At a global level, PAC may represent functional connectivity of the brain and changes in the strength or distribution of PAC may affect behavior.
